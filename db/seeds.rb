    DESCRIPTION: "is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 25, 1983, through the independent label Megaforce Records.

        NAME: "Hit the Lights",
        DESCRIPTION: 'is the first Metallica song ever written, James Hetfield originally wrote the song with his old band Leather Charm, and later, when he formed Metallica with Lars Ulrich, the two worked on the song and arranged it into what eventually became the album version of the song. The song, rather than the darker lyrics of later Metallica songs, has a more positive edge to it. It is about life on the road and living "metal".',

      THE_FOUR_HORSEMAN: {
        NAME: "The Four Horsemen",
        DESCRIPTION: "was originally written by Dave Mustaine in his former band Panic entitled \"The Mechanix\". The song was one of Metallica's staples during their clubbing days, albeit with no melodic interlude and different lyrics. The original lyrics were roughly about a sexual encounter at a gas station. James Hetfield has gone on to say the lyrics were \"silly\".",

      MOTORBREATH: {
        NAME: "Motorbreath",
        DESCRIPTION: "is about \"life in the fast lane\". James Hetfield wrote this song with his high school friend Hugh Tanner before Metallica was even formed, and is one of only two songs that Lars Ulrich doesn't receive a writing credit for. It is also the band's shortest song, clocking in at only three minutes and eight seconds.",

      JUMP_IN_THE_FIRE: {
        NAME: "Jump in the Fire",
        DESCRIPTION: "was released as the second single from Kill 'Em All, and was accompanied by fake live performances of \"Phantom Lord\" and \"Seek & Destroy\", which were alternate studio recordings with sounds of a crowd overdubbed in. The original lyrics were penned by Dave Mustaine - the song was originally about sex until he left the band and James got his hands on the song, changing the lyrics to make it a song about hell. In the song a devil persuades someone to join him in hell.",

        NAME: "Whiplash",
        DESCRIPTION: "is credited to James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich and was the sixth track and first single from their 1983 debut album Kill 'Em All. The song has been covered several times, most notably by Mot√∂rhead whose version won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. After bassist Jason Newsted joined the band in 1986, Jason sang the second and third verse. In 1999 and 2000 he did the entire song twice when James Hetfield had a back injury. The song is about the feeling one experiences when headbanging. (\"...thrashing all around, acting like a maniac, whiplash!..\") The song is on the game Guitar Hero: Metallica.",

      NO_REMORSE: {
        NAME: "No Remorse",
        DESCRIPTION: "is about how soldiers in a war are not meant to show any remorse while killing. An early version of the song appears on Ron McGovney's 1982 demo, and was often played live when Dave Mustaine was still in the band - in this version, however, the ending part has no vocals, and the lyrics for the chorus are slightly different. In 1993 a sample of the song's chorus was used in the famous game Doom, on the first level.",

      SEEK_AND_DESTROY: {
        NAME: "Seek & Destroy",
        DESCRIPTION: "subject matter is feeling the urge to kill. From the lyrics, it can be determined that the violence is directed towards someone who deserves it--perhaps, in Metallica's eyes, LA-based glam metal bands. It is said to be heavily influenced by the Diamond Head song \"Dead Reckoning.\"",

      METAL_MILITIA: {
        NAME: "Metal Militia",
        DESCRIPTION: "serves as something of a call to arms to all diehards to spread the 'word of metal', thus becoming the metal militia. The tone of the song is similar to that conveyed later in the track \"Battery\", which describes the metal community and the idea of uniting around the common interest of thrash.",
