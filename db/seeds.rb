The song, rather than the darker lyrics of later Metallica songs, has a more positive edge to it. It is about life on the road and living "metal".',

        DESCRIPTION: "was originally written by Dave Mustaine in his former band Panic entitled \"The Mechanix\". The song was one of Metallica's staples during their clubbing days, albeit with no melodic interlude and different lyrics. The original lyrics were roughly about a sexual encounter at a gas station. James Hetfield has gone on to say the lyrics were \"silly\".",

The original lyrics were penned by Dave Mustaine - the song was originally about sex until he left the band and James got his hands on the song, changing the lyrics to make it a song about hell. In the song a devil persuades someone to join him in hell.",

The song has been covered several times, most notably by Mot√∂rhead whose version won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. After bassist Jason Newsted joined the band in 1986, Jason sang the second and third verse. In 1999 and 2000 he did the entire song twice when James Hetfield had a back injury. The song is about the feeling one experiences when headbanging. (\"...thrashing all around, acting like a maniac, whiplash!..\") The song is on the game Guitar Hero: Metallica.",

An early version of the song appears on Ron McGovney's 1982 demo, and was often played live when Dave Mustaine was still in the band - in this version, however, the ending part has no vocals, and the lyrics for the chorus are slightly different. In 1993 a sample of the song's chorus was used in the famous game Doom, on the first level.",

  RIDE_THE_LIGHTNING: {
    NAME: "Ride the Lightning",
    DESCRIPTION: "is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand, in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying heavily on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It is the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett.",

        NAME: "Fight Fire with Fire",
        DESCRIPTION: "is about the end of the world being caused by heavy use of nuclear warfare (hence the line, \"nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest\"). The song suggests to \"fight fire with fire\" to potentially stop it, or possibly the term has been used so much, it is causing the end of the world. The same topic is also explored in a song called \"Blackened\", which is the opening track of Metallica's fourth album, ...And Justice for All. Fight Fire With Fire is also known to be one of Metallica's fastest and heaviest songs to date, with the main riff consisting of all sixteenth notes, requiring incredibly fast playing.",

      RIDE_THE_LIGHTNING: {
        NAME: "Ride the Lightning",
        DESCRIPTION: "deals with capital punishment and the flaws that come with it. The protagonist of the story depicted within the song is a man who is convicted for an unknown crime and is executed via electrocution. In many interviews Hetfield stated that the song is not critical against the capital punishment, but that he wrote the lyrics trying to express the point of view of a person who deals with the electric chair.",

        DESCRIPTION: "is about a section of the novel For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway, in which International Brigades soldiers of the Spanish Civil War attempt to escape the fascists with their stolen horses and are killed by enemy aircraft on a hill on which they are surrounded. \"Make his fight on the hill in the early day...\". The chromatic introduction (which is usually mistaken for an electric guitar) is in fact Cliff Burton playing his bass guitar through distortion and wah-wah. The intro was written by Burton before joining Metallica. Burton plays it in a 12-minute jam at a battle of the bands with his first band \"Agent of Misfortune.\" After the introduction, the bass settles into a steady triplet rhythm.",

      ESCAPE: {
        NAME: "Escape",
        DESCRIPTION: "is about escaping from reality, and living the way you want to (hence the lines, \"life's for my own to live my own way\"). It is about an escaped prisoner on the run, which can also be interpreted as an escape from everything which is preventing you from doing what you want to or even from being as you want to be. Another interpretation possibility is to live your life the way you want to live it, not the way anybody wants you to. Near the end of the song you can hear prison sirens in the background to emphasize the escape.",

        NAME: "Creeping Death",
        DESCRIPTION: "is based off the second half of the movie The Ten Commandments, when the plagues are spreading and killing the people. Cliff Burton commented on it, saying that it was like \"creeping death\". The \"creeping death\" is actually the Plague of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). Some of the other plagues are mentioned in the song as well.",

      THE_CALL_OF_KTULU: {
        NAME: "The Call of Ktulu",
        DESCRIPTION: "appears on a 1983 four-song demo for Ride the Lightning. Like the album, the demo closes with the instrumental, which was named \"When Hell Freezes Over\" at the time. The song was often played much faster live than the finished version. The current title of the song is named after author H.P. Lovecraft's most well-known story, the Call of Cthulhu. Lovecraft was introduced, along with his book \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", to the rest of the band by Cliff Burton. The latter song inspired \"The Thing That Should Not Be\", written by Burton. In Lovecraft's stories, Cthulhu is a powerful, God-like alien from another dimension, who is worshipped by cults on earth who believe it is a demonic God - the song has various demonic growls and noises throughout.",
